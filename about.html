        <h2>Why I am taking this course: </h2>
		<p>I am taking CIT 312 because I am looking to learn more about web development as well as build my project resume so I can have good projects to possibly show
            to employers when I have an interview. This class is also one I have to take which is the obvious reason but I would really like to learn more and create cool
            projects. Also, this course will give me a lot better understanding of the more advanced and real-world side of web design.
        </p>
        <h2>What I hope to acheive:</h2>
        <li>I hope to create some really cool projects that can be used for future interviews.</li>
        <li>With the course being group-based, I want to be as helpful as possible to my group.</li>
        <li>I want to become a lot more knowledgable on the different aspects of advanced web design.</li>
