    <h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Braden McLane and I am a CIT Major with the concentration of Web Development. I am in my 5th year and plan to graduate in December.
            I am from Shelbyville, Indiana which is where I have spent my whole life. I enjoy watching NFL football and I am a die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan.
            When the weather is nice, I enjoy doing activities outside like kayaking or hiking trails.
